Chapter 1. Exploratory data analysis

Classical statistics focused on drawing conclusions about large populations 
based on small samples. In 1962, John W. Tukey called for a reformation of statistics 
in his seminal paper “The Future of Data Analysis” and proposed a new scientific
discipline called data analysis that included statistical inference as just one 
component and considered engineering and computer science communities.The field of 
exploratory data analysis was established with Tukey’s 1977 now-classic book 
Exploratory Data Analysis.
